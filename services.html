    <summary>Adult Day Support</summary>

    <p>
      We use the Ohio Administrative Code that follows the rule that defines adult
      day support and sets forth provider qualifications, requirements for service
      delivery and documentation of services, and payment standards for the service.
    </p>

    <p>
      The expected outcome of adult day support is development of skills that lead
      to greater independence, community membership, relationship building,
      self-direction, and self-advocacy.
    </p>

    <p>Definitions For the purposes of this rule, the following definitions apply:</p>

    <p>
    1. "Adult day support" means provision of regularly scheduled activities in a non-residential setting, such as assistance with acquisition, retention, or improvement of self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills that enhance the individual's social development and performance of daily community living. Adult day support shall be designed to foster the acquisition of skills, build community membership and independence, and expand personal choice. Adult day support enables the individual to attain and maintain his or her maximum potential. Activities that constitute adult day support include but are not limited to: 
    </p>

    <ul class="law">
      <li>
        Supports to participate in community activities and build community membership consistent with the individual's interests, preferences, goals, and outcomes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Supports to develop and maintain a meaningful social life, including social skill development which offers opportunities for personal growth, independence, and natural supports through community involvement, participation, and relationships. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Supports and opportunities that increase problem-solving skills to maximize an individual's ability to participate in integrated community activities independently or with natural supports. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Personal care including supports and supervision in the areas of personal hygiene, eating, communication, mobility, toileting, and dressing to ensure an individual's ability to experience and participate in community living.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skill reinforcement including the implementation of behavioral support strategies, assistance in the use of communication and mobility devices, and other activities that reinforce skills learned by the individual that are necessary to ensure his or her initial and continued participation in community life. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Training in self-determination which includes assisting the individual to develop self-advocacy skills; to exercise his or her civil rights; to exercise control and responsibility over the services he or she receives; and to acquire skills that enable him or her to become more independent, productive, and integrated within the community. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Recreation and leisure including supports identified in the person-centered individual service plan as being therapeutic in nature, rather than merely providing a diversion, and/or as being necessary to assist the individual to develop and/or maintain social relationships and family contacts.  
      </li>
      <li>
       Assisting the individual with self-medication or provision of medication administration for prescribed medication and assisting the individual with or performing health-related activities in accordance with Chapters 5123-6 and 5123:2-6 of the Administrative Code.
      </li>

    <summary>Shared Living</summary>
    <p>
    "Shared living" means <strong>individual-specific personal care and support</strong> necessary to meet the day-to-day needs of an adult enrolled in the individual options waiver, by an adult caregiver who resides in the same home as the individual receiving the services.
    </p>

    <p>
Specific personal care and support necessary to meet the day-to-day needs of an adult enrolled in the individual options waiver, by an adult caregiver who resides in the same home as the individual receiving the services. Shared living is provided in conjunction with residing in the home and is part of the rhythm of life that naturally occurs when people live together in the same home. Due to the environment provided by living together in the same home, segregating these activities into discrete services is impractical.
    </p>
